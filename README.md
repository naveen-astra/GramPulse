## Authentication Flow

GramPulse implements a secure authentication flow:

1. **Language Selection**: Users first select their preferred language
2. **Phone Number Input**: Users enter their phone number
3. **OTP Verification**: A 6-digit OTP is sent to the user's phone
4. **OTP Validation**: User enters the OTP to verify identity
5. **Profile Setup**: First-time users set up their profile (name, role, optional email)
6. **Role Selection**: Users select their role (citizen, volunteer, officer)
7. **Home Screen**: Users are directed to role-specific home screens

The `AuthBloc` manages this entire flow, handling state transitions and API calls through the `AuthService`.

### Key Authentication Files

- `lib/core/services/auth_service.dart`: Handles authentication API calls
- `lib/features/auth/bloc/auth_bloc.dart`: Manages authentication state
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/login_screen.dart`: Phone input UI
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/otp_verification_screen.dart`: OTP verification UI
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/profile_setup_screen.dart`: Profile setup UI

## Role-Based System

GramPulse implements a comprehensive role-based system that determines user access, UI, and functionality:

### 1. Citizen
- Report new issues
- Track report status
- Comment on reports
- View nearby issues
- Access community resources

### 2. Volunteer
- Verify citizen reports
- Assist citizens with reporting
- Coordinate with officials
- Monitor community issues
- Update report status

### 3. Officer
- Receive assigned reports
- Update report status
- Resolve issues
- Communicate with citizens
- Generate work orders

### 4. Administrator
- Manage users and roles
- Assign reports to officers
- Access system analytics
- Configure system settings
- Monitor overall performance

The router (`lib/app/router.dart`) enforces role-based access control, preventing unauthorized access to role-specific routes.

## State Management

GramPulse uses the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management:

### 1. AuthBloc
- Manages authentication state
- Handles OTP requests and verification
- Manages profile completion
- Controls user sessions

**Key files**:
- `lib/features/auth/bloc/auth_bloc.dart`: Authentication state management
- `lib/features/auth/bloc/auth_event.dart`: Authentication events
- `lib/features/auth/bloc/auth_state.dart`: Authentication states

### 2. ReportBloc
- Manages report creation, updates, and deletion
- Handles report filtering and searching
- Manages comments and status updates
- Controls report assignment

**Key files**:
- `lib/features/report/bloc/report_bloc.dart`: Report state management
- `lib/features/report/bloc/report_event.dart`: Report events
- `lib/features/report/bloc/report_state.dart`: Report states

### 3. Other Feature-Specific BLoCs
- CitizenHomeBloc: Manages citizen dashboard
- NearbyIssuesBloc: Handles map and nearby issues
- OfficerDashboardBloc: Manages officer dashboard

The BLoC pattern provides clear separation of UI, business logic, and data, making the codebase maintainable and testable.

## API Integration

GramPulse communicates with a RESTful backend API:

### 1. ApiService
- HTTP client for API calls
- Token management
- Request/response handling
- Error handling

**Key file**: `lib/core/services/api_service.dart`

### 2. AuthService
- Authentication API calls
- Token storage
- User profile management

**Key file**: `lib/core/services/auth_service.dart`

### 3. ReportService
- Report CRUD operations
- Comment management
- Status updates
- File uploads

**Key file**: `lib/core/services/report_service.dart`

### API Response Format
All API responses follow a standardized format:
```json
{
  "success": true|false,
  "message": "Response message",
  "data": {...},
  "statusCode": 200
}
```

## Installation and Setup

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/grampulse.git
   cd grampulse
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Configure backend URL
   Open `lib/core/services/api_service.dart` and update the `baseUrl`:
   ```dart
   // For Android emulator
   static const String baseUrl = 'http://10.0.2.2:3000/api';
   
   // For iOS simulator
   // static const String baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/api';
   
   // For physical device (replace with your computer's IP)
   // static const String baseUrl = 'http://192.168.1.xxx:3000/api';
   ```

## Running the Application

### Starting the Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory
   ```
   cd path/to/GramPulse-Backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Running the Flutter App
1. Start an emulator or connect a physical device

2. Run the Flutter app
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

## Backend Integration

The Flutter frontend integrates with a Node.js/Express backend:

### API Endpoints

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/request-otp`: Request OTP for phone verification
- `POST /api/auth/verify-otp`: Verify OTP and get JWT token
- `GET /api/users/me`: Get current user profile
- `POST /api/users/complete-profile`: Complete user profile

#### Reports
- `GET /api/reports`: Get all reports (with optional filters)
- `GET /api/reports/me`: Get reports created by current user
- `GET /api/reports/:id`: Get a specific report
- `POST /api/reports`: Create a new report
- `PUT /api/reports/:id`: Update a report
- `DELETE /api/reports/:id`: Delete a report
- `POST /api/reports/:id/comments`: Add a comment to a report
- `PUT /api/reports/:id/status`: Update report status
- `PUT /api/reports/:id/assign`: Assign report to an officer

### Authentication Flow
1. The app sends a phone number to `/api/auth/request-otp`
2. The backend generates and sends a 6-digit OTP
3. The app sends the OTP to `/api/auth/verify-otp`
4. If valid, the backend returns a JWT token and user info
5. The app stores the token in SharedPreferences
6. Subsequent API calls include the token in the Authorization header

## Detailed File Descriptions

### Core Services

#### 1. `lib/core/services/api_service.dart`
This file implements a generic HTTP client for communicating with the backend API. Key components include:

- **ApiResponse<T> class**: A generic wrapper for standardized API responses
- **ApiService class**: Handles HTTP requests with proper error handling
- **Token Management**: Automatically adds authentication tokens to requests
- **HTTP Methods**: Implementation of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods
- **File Upload**: Support for multipart requests with file uploads
- **Response Processing**: Standardized handling of API responses

Usage example:
```dart
final apiService = ApiService();
final response = await apiService.get<User>(
  '/users/me',
  (data) => User.fromJson(data),
);
```

#### 2. `lib/core/services/auth_service.dart`
This service handles all authentication-related operations:

- **User Model**: Defines the user data structure
- **Authentication Methods**: OTP request, verification, and profile completion
- **Session Management**: Token storage and retrieval
- **Profile Management**: User profile updates and retrieval
- **Authentication State**: Checks if the user is authenticated

Usage example:
```dart
final authService = AuthService();
final response = await authService.requestOtp('1234567890');
```

#### 3. `lib/core/services/report_service.dart`
This service manages all report-related operations:

- **Report Models**: Defines data structures for reports, comments, and locations
- **Report Management**: CRUD operations for reports
- **Comment System**: Adding and retrieving comments
- **Status Updates**: Updating report status
- **Assignment**: Assigning reports to officers
- **Filtering**: Getting reports with various filters

Usage example:
```dart
final reportService = ReportService();
final response = await reportService.createReport(
  title: 'Water shortage',
  description: 'No water supply for 3 days',
  category: 'WATER',
  // Other required fields
);
```

### State Management (BLoC)

#### 1. `lib/features/auth/bloc/auth_bloc.dart`
This file implements the authentication BLoC pattern:

- **AuthEvent**: Abstract class for auth events (RequestOtp, VerifyOtp, etc.)
- **AuthState**: Abstract class for auth states (Authenticated, Unauthenticated, etc.)
- **AuthBloc**: Handles state transitions based on events
- **Event Handlers**: Implementation of event handlers for auth flow

The AuthBloc coordinates the entire authentication flow, from OTP request to login to logout.

Usage example:
```dart
// Request OTP
context.read<AuthBloc>().add(RequestOtp('1234567890'));

// Verify OTP
context.read<AuthBloc>().add(VerifyOtp('1234567890', '123456'));

// Complete profile
context.read<AuthBloc>().add(CompleteProfile(
  name: 'John Doe',
  role: 'citizen',
));

// Logout
context.read<AuthBloc>().add(Logout());
```

#### 2. `lib/features/report/bloc/report_bloc.dart`
This file implements the report management BLoC pattern:

- **ReportEvent**: Abstract class for report events (CreateReport, UpdateReport, etc.)
- **ReportState**: Abstract class for report states (ReportsLoaded, ReportError, etc.)
- **ReportBloc**: Handles state transitions based on events
- **Event Handlers**: Implementation of event handlers for report operations

The ReportBloc manages all report-related state, from creation to updates to filtering.

Usage example:
```dart
// Load all reports
context.read<ReportBloc>().add(LoadAllReports());

// Create a new report
context.read<ReportBloc>().add(CreateReport(
  title: 'Road damage',
  description: 'Pothole on main street',
  category: 'ROAD',
  // Other required fields
));

// Update report status
context.read<ReportBloc>().add(UpdateReportStatus(
  reportId: 'report-id',
  status: 'IN_PROGRESS',
));
```

- **Route Definitions**: Path, name, and builder for each route
- **Nested Routes**: Shell routes with nested child routes
- **Authentication Guards**: Redirects based on authentication state
- **Role-Based Access**: Route protection based on user role
- **Parameter Passing**: Passing parameters between routes

The router implements sophisticated logic for:
1. Redirecting unauthenticated users to login
2. Directing authenticated users to appropriate role-specific screens
3. Handling deep links and navigation history
4. Enforcing role-based access control

### Main Application

#### `lib/app/app.dart`

The main application widget that:

- Sets up the global providers (AuthBloc, ReportBloc)
- Configures the router

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. **OTP Request**:
   ```dart
   // AuthBloc handles the RequestOtp event
   Future<void> _onRequestOtp(RequestOtp event, Emitter<AuthState> emit) async {
     emit(AuthLoading());
     try {
       final response = await _authService.requestOtp(event.phone);
       if (response.success) {
         emit(OtpRequested(event.phone));
       } else {
         emit(AuthError(response.message));
       }
     } catch (e) {
       emit(AuthError(e.toString()));
     }
   }
   ```

2. **OTP Verification**:
   ```dart
   // AuthBloc handles the VerifyOtp event
   Future<void> _onVerifyOtp(VerifyOtp event, Emitter<AuthState> emit) async {
     emit(AuthLoading());
     try {
       final response = await _authService.verifyOtp(event.phone, event.otp);
       if (response.success && response.data != null) {
         final user = response.data!;
         emit(Authenticated(user, isProfileComplete: user.isProfileComplete));
       } else {
         emit(OtpVerificationFailed(response.message));
       }
     } catch (e) {
       emit(AuthError(e.toString()));
     }
   }
   ```

### API Request/Response Handling

```dart
// ApiService processes HTTP responses
ApiResponse<T> _processResponse<T>(
  http.Response response,
  T Function(dynamic)? fromJson,
) {
  try {
    final responseBody = json.decode(response.body);
    
    if (response.statusCode >= 200 && response.statusCode < 300) {
      // Successful response
      return ApiResponse(
        success: responseBody['success'] ?? true,
        message: responseBody['message'] ?? 'Success',
        data: responseBody['data'] != null && fromJson != null 
            ? fromJson(responseBody['data']) 
            : null,
        statusCode: response.statusCode,
      );
    } else {
      // Error response
      return ApiResponse(
        success: false,
        message: responseBody['message'] ?? 'Server error',
        statusCode: response.statusCode,
      );
    }
  } catch (e) {
    // Invalid JSON or other parsing error
    return ApiResponse(
      success: false,
      message: 'Failed to parse response: ${e.toString()}',
      statusCode: response.statusCode,
    );
  }
}
```

### Role-Based Routing

```dart
// Router handles role-based redirects
if (authState is Authenticated) {
  // If authenticated with complete profile but in auth path, redirect to home
  if (inAuthPath) {
    switch (authState.user.role) {
      case 'citizen':
        return '/citizen';
      case 'volunteer':
        return '/volunteer';
      case 'officer':
        return '/officer';
      case 'admin':
        return '/admin';
      default:
        return '/citizen';
    }
  }
  
  // Verify role-specific access
  if (location.startsWith('/citizen') && authState.user.role != 'citizen') {
    // Redirect to appropriate role-specific home
  }
  
  // Similar checks for other roles
}
```
