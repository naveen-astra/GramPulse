🌾 GramPulse: Village Sustainability Index Tracker
GramPulse is a civic-tech platform designed to empower rural citizens, streamline grievance redressal, and generate real-time sustainability metrics for villages. It transforms fragmented governance into a transparent, accountable system—bridging the gap between citizens, agencies, and policymakers.

🌟 Overview
In many rural regions, governance is reactive instead of proactive. Citizens raise issues—water shortages, broken roads, sanitation failures—but there is often:

No clear timeline for resolution
No accountability across departments
No standard metric to measure village well-being
GramPulse solves this by introducing a Village Sustainability Index (VSI):
a dynamic score that reflects the health, responsiveness, and resilience of a village.

🚨 The Problem
Grievances are raised through scattered channels (paper, calls, local visits).
There is no unified grievance pipeline with tracking or escalation.
Citizens rarely know:
Who is responsible?
What is the status?
Why is it delayed?
Agencies lack real-time dashboards to prioritize interventions.
Policymakers don't have live, ground-level data for policy decisions.
This leads to:

Unresolved issues
Eroded public trust
Purely reactive governance
✅ The Solution: Village Sustainability Index (VSI)
GramPulse introduces a Village Sustainability Index (VSI) that updates in real time based on:

Grievance volume and resolution rate
Time taken vs SLA (Service Level Agreement)
Infrastructure status and recurring issues
Citizen feedback and satisfaction
How It Works
Citizens submit grievances via a simple web interface.
Agencies receive assigned issues with clear SLA timelines.
Each state change (created, in-progress, resolved, overdue) updates the VSI.
All records are:
Traceable
Auditable
Publicly visible in a dashboard
This creates a feedback loop where:

Transparency → drives accountability
Data → drives policy & funding decisions

🔗 Web3 Relevance
GramPulse leverages Web3 to strengthen trust and auditability:

Each grievance (or batch of grievances) generates a content hash stored on-chain.
This ensures:
Records can’t be silently modified or deleted.
Citizens and auditors can independently verify grievance history.
Future roadmap includes:
DAO-based funding for critical village projects
Citizen voting to prioritize issues and budget allocation
